This Python script defines a Flask application for a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) system interacting with a MySQL database. Here's a summary of its functionalities and dependencies:

Dependencies:
Flask: A micro web framework for Python.
Flask-MySQLdb: An extension for Flask that integrates MySQL databases.
Flask-Bcrypt: An extension for Flask to handle password hashing.
Functionality:
Initialization:

The Flask app is created and configured.
Bcrypt is initialized for password hashing.
Secret key for session management is set.
MySQL database connection is established.
Routes:

Home Route (/): Renders the home page. If a user is logged in, it shows their username and admin status.
Login Route (/login): Handles user login. Validates username and password against the database.
Logout Route (/logout): Logs out the user by removing session data.
Default Route (/default): Displays a list of users with their information fetched from the database.
Insert Route (/insert): Handles insertion of new user data into the database.
Update Route (/update): Handles updating user data in the database.
Database Operations:

User Authentication: Validates user login credentials against stored data.
User Insertion: Inserts new user data into the database.
User Update: Updates existing user data in the database.
Additional Notes:
Passwords are hashed using bcrypt before storing in the database.
SQL injection vulnerability is present in the login route. Prefer using parameterized queries to avoid it.
There's a logical error in the update route: the SQL update query is targeting a table named 'users' instead of 'tbl_users'.
Some parts of the code are commented out, indicating potential future enhancements or debugging steps.
The application runs in debug mode for development purposes.
Overall, this application serves as a basic CRUD system with user authentication, using Flask and MySQL for backend operations.
